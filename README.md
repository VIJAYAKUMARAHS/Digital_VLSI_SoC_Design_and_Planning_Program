# DIGITAL VLSI SOC DESIGN AND PLANNING 
Hello, everyone! I'll be sharing what I have learned during a 2 weeks of workshop on Digital VLSI SOC design and planning using openLANE tool and sky-130nm PDK under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh, VLSI System Design(VSD) pvt.ltd.

## Day 1 -Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and sky130 PDK

## How to talk to computers
### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs

ARDUINO BOARD: Lets start with an  arduino board, the encircled area is a microcontroller chip. to design such chip or IC we have to follow the ASCI design flow.
